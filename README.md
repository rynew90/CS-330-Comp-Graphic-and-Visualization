1. How do I approach designing software?
    1. What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

       ```This project has helped me in learning how to render 3D objects in a scene. Allowing me to learn skills that will help make similar coding projects easier to do in the future.```
  
    2. What design process did you follow for your project work?

       ```I chose to follow an object oriented approach when developing the code for this project. Keeping the code separated helps to keep the entire project more neat and easily understood by others who may be viewing my code. It will also allow for quicker setup and less effort in coding future projects.```
  
    3. How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

       ```These tactics can be applied to future work by allowing me to quickly and easily set up projects with the necessary libraries and files to allow the code to run properly, without spending time trying to set up the project before coding.```

2. How do I approach developing programs?

    1. What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

       ```I had to learn how to structure each part of the code so that it would work seamlessly and render the objects as desired. I employed new development strategies that allowed me to find the proper structure that would render the objects with their textures properly.```
  
    2. How did iteration factor into your development?

       ```Iteration was a vital aspect in the development of this project. I used iteration to my advantage in order to create the scene and keep the scene structured as intended while moving around the scene manually to view it from different angles.```
  
    3. How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

       ```When I first started the course, I was using more of a brute force approach at coding the assignments. As I continued, I noticed that a lot of the code could be abstracted into their own methods that would allow for less code and an easier to understand code base that is more reuseable.```

3. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

    1. How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?

       ```This course gave me important knowledge and skills to create and render 3D graphics in a scene that will be vital to my future education in allowing me to create graphics that may help to illustrate future coding projects that I may be tasked with completing.```
